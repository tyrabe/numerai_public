# Tyler's Public Numerai 

## Check out my staked model 
https://numer.ai/raven490

## Background
- This repository is a demonstration of some of my work around the Numerai data science tournament (https://docs.numer.ai/tournament/learn).  
- The Numerai data science tournament is a daily tournament that allows modelers to submit predictions on obfuscated stock market data. 
- You have the ability to stake Numerai cryptocurrency (NMR) against your predictions and get daily payouts (or burns) based on model performance. 
- Staking a model allows you to have skin in the game on your models performance.
- Check out my notebooks folder for an example LightGBM model

## Notes
- The example models are NOT models I use in production, they are used to demonstrate some of my modeling/coding abilities. 
- My production model is scored and submitted daily.  

Also check out the performance of the cryptocurrency NMR via tradingview.  Performance of the asset NMR could potentially be incorporated into your staking regime.
