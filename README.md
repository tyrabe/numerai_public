# Tyler's Public Numerai 

This repository is a demonstration of some of my work around the Numerai data science tournament.  NOTE: These are NOT models I use in production, just example models to demonstrate some of my coding abilities.  My production model is scored weekly and my submissions are submitted.  The performance of the model can be found in the link below.
