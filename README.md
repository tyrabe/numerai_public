# Tyler's Public Numerai 

## Background
- This repository is a demonstration of some of my work around the Numerai data science tournament (https://docs.numer.ai/tournament/learn).  
- The Numerai data science tournament is a weekly tournament that allows modelers to submit predictions on obfuscated stock market data. 
- You have the ability to stake Numerai cryptocurrency (NMR) against your predictions and get weekly payouts (or burns) based on model performance. 

## Notes
- These are NOT models I use in production, just example models to demonstrate some of my coding abilities. \
- My production model is scored weekly and my submissions are submitted every weekend.  \
- The performance of the staked model can be found in the link below.  
- Current performance as of April 2022 is 82.9% yearly return on my stake.

Also check out the performance of the cryptocurrency NMR via tradingview.  Performance of the asset NMR could potentially be incorporated into your staking regime.
